# Currency-Converter-NetBeans
In this I made a currency converter using Netbeans where the programming language used was Java. A currency converter is software code that is designed to convert one currency into another in order to check its corresponding value.

In order to convert one currency into another, a user enters an amount of money (e.g. '100') and chooses the currency he/she wishes to check the monetary value of (e.g. 'United States Dollar').

After that, the user selects one, or sometimes several other currencies, he/she would like to see the result in.
The Exchange rates can of course be changed as desired
